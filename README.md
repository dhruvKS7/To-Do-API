# To-Do-API

The To-Do-API allows for effective management of to-do lists through routes that are specific to user management or task management. Tasks can be owned by different users, and the owner can be switched as well. Tasks can have their status change from to-do to done as well, allowing for a comprehensive system that meets the needs of any to-do list.
